#### Why?
I have been needing a place to store and showcase my research for a while and i thought it time I got myself on the Internet.

##### Virtualisation
I primarily use Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) for virtualization with a fallback to also providing configuration files for Oracle Virtualbox where appropriate. While it's free and a go to tool in a lot of researchers setups I feel it's a bit slow when it comes to automation and as such i prefer KVM.

##### Automation
I have two go to automation technologies. Packer from Hashicorp and Ansible from Redhat. I find the standalone binary for Packer useful from the context of little to no dependencies and Ansible as an agentless tool gives me the most flexibility.
When labs require or would benefit from the usage of an agent based tool i favor Puppet from PuppetLabs.

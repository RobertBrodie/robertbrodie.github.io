This site is primarily focussed on security topics that interest me and will provide code and lab setups that i use for training and study.

### About Me

I am a keen security researcher, focussing on penetration testing and malware forensics. I use automation tooling where appropriate to ensure the labs use repeatable builds allowing for reasearch that has mobility and is able to be leveraged by other researchers.
